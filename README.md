# EcoCabin-Predictor

Final project for the Building AI course


## Summary

EcoCabin Predictor is a web-based tool that helps users estimate the cost of building environmentally friendly cabins based on various features such as size, amenities, and location. It uses a linear regression model to predict prices accurately and provides users with valuable insights to make informed decisions.


## Background

The growing interest in sustainable living has led to an increase in the demand for eco-friendly cabins. However, potential cabin buyers often struggle to estimate the cost of building these cabins, taking into account numerous features and environmental considerations. This problem is common among property developers, real estate agents, and individuals looking to invest in eco-friendly properties. Promoting sustainable living is crucial for combating climate change and preserving the environment. By providing an easy-to-use tool, EcoCabin Predictor aims to support the green building movement and help users make more sustainable choices. This project aids in simplifying the cost estimation process, making it accessible and efficient for anyone interested in constructing eco-friendly cabins.


## How is it used?

EcoCabin Predictor can be used by property developers, architects, real estate agents, and eco-conscious individuals. It provides them with a user-friendly interface to input various cabin features and receive price predictions. The primary users affected by this tool are those involved in building, selling, or purchasing eco-friendly cabins. It benefits them by streamlining the cost estimation process and promoting sustainable building practices.


## Data sources and AI methods

The project relies on historical data of eco-friendly cabins, including various features such as size, number of bathrooms, size of sauna, and other amenities, along with their corresponding prices. The data can be sourced from real estate listings, property databases, and environmental consultation firms. The primary technique used is linear regression. This model will be trained on the dataset mentioned above to learn the relationship between the features of an eco-friendly cabin and its price.


## Challenges

Limitations:
* The accuracy of the predictions depends heavily on the quality and volume of the dataset.
* It may not account for unforeseen costs or fluctuations in the market.
* It does not provide detailed breakdowns of costs specific to different eco-friendly features.


## What next?

Future Expansion:
* Integration with real-time data sources for dynamic price updates.
* Enhancing the prediction model with more sophisticated techniques like Random Forest or Neural Networks.
* Adding interactive visualization tools to help users understand the impact of different features on pricing.
* Expanding the dataset to include more diverse and specific eco-friendly features.
